# IMDB-Movie-Analysis
Here I are trying to build a system through which I will be able to
track the highest profit movies or top movies. Through this IMDB
movie analytics I will measure certain parameters which in turn will
help us grow as a company and also most certainly help in
understanding our flaws. By this way the MNCs get to know about
the actors or directors whom most people like. These analytics are the

foundation pillar of the success of any organisation. Trends such as-
imdb rating, top directors, most popular genres, top foreign language

movie etc. are important for a company to analyse before producing a
movie.
I have been given a dataset of a company various columns of different
IMDB Movies is given. Knowledge in statistics and different
formulas in excel are used to draw necessary conclusions about the
company.
